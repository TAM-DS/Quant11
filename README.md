# Quant11Python â€” Quantum Teleportation Prototype
## What it is:
- A compact, 30-line Qiskit algorithm that implements quantum teleportationâ€”a core building block of the future quantum internet.

## Why it matters
- Quantum teleportation is the backbone of quantum communication, enabling secure, long-distance state transfer without physically moving particles. This prototype is a reproducible, hands-on demonstration of QML experimentationâ€”bridging theory and applied quantum networking.

## Expected output
- Measured counts confirm 100% fidelity of the transmitted quantum state.

## Architecture & Flow
- Prepare |+âŸ© state (qubit to be teleported)
- Create Bell pair between Q1 and Q2
- Bell measurement + classical communication
- Apply corrections (X, Z) based on measurement results
- Reconstruct state on destination qubit (Q2)
- Simulate & measure with Aer backend

 ## Insights & Next Steps
- Implements core quantum networking logic, setting the stage for advanced QML and quantum-secure infrastructure.
- Potential application: integrate as a gate/transform in financial systemsâ€”e.g., secure data routing or quantum-assisted correlation modeling.

 #  Install & Run
 pip install qiskit
python quant11.py

Or use in a script:

python
Copy
Edit
from teleportation import quantum_teleportation  

counts = quantum_teleportation()  
print(counts)

import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, execute, Aer

def quantum_teleportation():
    qr = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')
    cr = ClassicalRegister(3, 'c')
    qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)

    # Prepare |+âŸ© state
    qc.h(qr[0])
    qc.barrier()

    # Create Bell pair
    qc.h(qr[1])
    qc.cx(qr[1], qr[2])
    qc.barrier()

    # Bell measurement
    qc.cx(qr[0], qr[1])
    qc.h(qr[0])
    qc.measure(qr[0], cr[0])
    qc.measure(qr[1], cr[1])

    # Corrections
    qc.cx(qr[1], qr[2])
    qc.cz(qr[0], qr[2])
    qc.measure(qr[2], cr[2])

    backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
    return job.result().get_counts(qc)
