# Quant11Python Quantum Teleportation ‚Äî Experimental Prototype
##This 30-line algorithm implements quantum teleportation - the foundation of quantum internet
## Why it matters:
Quantum teleportation underpins quantum communication and sets the stage for secure, next-gen infrastructure. This serves as a clear, reproducible footprint of hands-on QML experimentation.
Expected output:
Measured counts indicate successful teleportation with 100% fidelity of the transmitted quantum state.

Architecture & Flow:

Prepare |+‚ü© state

Create Bell pair

Bell measurement + classical communication

Correction gates (X, Z)

State reconstruction on qubit 2

Result via simulation-based counts

Insights & Next Steps:

Implements core quantum networking logic‚Äîsolid foundation for future work in QML or quantum communication.

Next exploration: apply this as a gate or transform in financial tasks, such as secure data routing or quantum-assisted correlation modeling.
